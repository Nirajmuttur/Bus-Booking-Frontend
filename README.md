# Bus Booking System

A bus booking system allows users to book and manage bus tickets through a web-based application. The UI is typically built using web development technologies such as ReactJS, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript, and can be integrated with a backend system for handling reservations and ticketing.


## The UI would include features such as:

- A search function for finding available bus routes and schedules
- Login
- Sign Up
- Cross platform
